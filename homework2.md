    To view the branches, enter (_git branch_)  

    To switch to another branch, enter (_git checkout < name of your branch >_)

* _merging branches in the state fast-forward_

    Merging _Fast-Forward_ is when the elements of a branch go into the main body without disputes, following each other

    With such a merge, a commit about this is created automatically

* _merging branches in the state ort strategy_

    If, during the merge, the master changes not only in the part of the body going further, but also in the part of the master before, while not creating a conflict, the merge will occur

    In this case, after the merge, you need to create a commit

* _conflicts and their resolution_

    1. selecting a specific branch

    2. combining branches
